Description:     libtatsu is part of the libimobiledevice project.
  The main purpose is to allow creating TSS request payloads,
  sending them to Apple's TSS server, and retrieving and processing the
  response. The code was originally part of idevicerestore and has been split
  out to its own library, while obviously idevicerestore will remain the main
  consumer.
