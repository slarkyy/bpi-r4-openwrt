Title: Debug multicast setups with mtools (msend and mreceive)
Maintainer: 
Source: net-mtools-3.2.tar.zst
URL: https://github.com/troglobit/mtools
Type: ipkg
Description:   The tools msend and mreceive can be particulary useful
  when debugging multicast setups.

  msend continuously sends UDP packets to the multicast
  group specified by the -g and -p options.

  mreceive joins a multicast group specified by the -g and
  -p options, then receives and displays the multicast
  packets sent to this group:port combination by the msend
  command.
