Description: libwacom is a library to identify graphics tablets and their model-specific
features. It provides easy access to information such as "is this a built-in
on-screen tablet", "what is the size of this model", etc.

The name libwacom is historical - it was originally developed for Wacom devices
only but now supports any graphics tablet from any vendor.
