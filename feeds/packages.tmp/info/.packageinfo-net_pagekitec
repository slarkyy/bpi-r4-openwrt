Description:   PageKite is a system for running publicly visible servers (generally
web servers) on machines without a direct connection to the Internet,
such as mobile devices or computers behind restrictive firewalls.
PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations by
using a combination of tunnels and reverse proxies.

This package provides an implementation of the PageKite Protocol in C,
optimized for high-performance or embedded applications.


This package contains a basic backend useful for exposing http/ssh servers.

Basic UCI support for configuring this backend is also included.
