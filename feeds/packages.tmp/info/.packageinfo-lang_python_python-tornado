Description:   Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library,
  originally developed at FriendFeed. By using non-blocking network I/O,
  Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it
  ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require
  a long-lived connection to each user.
