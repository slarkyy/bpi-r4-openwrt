Description: BIRD is an internet routing daemon which manages TCP/IP routing tables
with support of modern routing protocols, easy to use configuration
interface and powerful route filtering language. It is lightweight and
efficient and therefore appropriate for small embedded routers.

BIRD supports OSPFv2, RIPv2, Babel and BGP protocols for IPv4 and
OSPFv3, RIPng, Babel and BGP protocols for IPv6.

In BGP, BIRD supports communities, multiprotocol extensions, MD5
authentication, 32bit AS numbers and could act as a route server or a
route reflector. BIRD also supports multiple RIBs, multiple kernel
routing tables and redistribution between the protocols with a powerful
configuration syntax.

This is the 3.0 branch of Bird which is a multithreaded rewrite.

Description: BIRD is an internet routing daemon which manages TCP/IP routing tables
with support of modern routing protocols, easy to use configuration
interface and powerful route filtering language. It is lightweight and
efficient and therefore appropriate for small embedded routers.

This is a BIRD command-line client. It is used to send commands to BIRD,
commands can perform simple actions such as enabling/disabling of
protocols, telling BIRD to show various information, telling it to show
a routing table filtered by a filter, or asking BIRD to reconfigure.

Unless you can't afford dependency on ncurses and readline, you
should install BIRD command-line client together with BIRD.
