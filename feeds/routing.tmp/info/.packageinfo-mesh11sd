Description:   Mesh11sd is a package that autonomously configures and manages all aspects of an 802.11s mesh network and its connected nodes.
  The package acts as a service daemon, dynamically setting mesh parameters across all nodes.
  It is particularly useful for simplifying setup, reducing manual configuration, and improving network reliability.
  Support for point to multi-point vxlan tunneling over the wireless backhaul is included as standard.
  A guest/iot type network is auto-configured without requiring complex vlan setup.
  If required, custom vlan trunking over the vxlan tunnel is supported.
  Mesh-gate access point usage is collected in a central database on the mesh portal.
  A command line interface is provided for reporting in json format output.
  An optional Customer/Client Premises Equipment (CPE) mode, greatly simplifies rollout of community WISP projects.
